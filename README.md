# AItherNet
AItherNet is an experimental prototype developed in Python that simulates a community of autonomous AI agents within a virtual environment. The goal is to create an interactive platform where agents—drawing inspiration from medieval fantasy settings (with potential evolution toward modern or cyberpunk contexts)—interact and live their own "lives", generating complex dynamics.

## Main Features
- **Multi-agent Simulation:** A virtual environment where autonomous agents possess attributes (e.g., health, hunger, energy) and interact.

- **Modular Approach:** An initial prototype focused on Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) concepts and artificial intelligence.

- **AI Experimentation:** A base for studying machine learning, deep learning, and interactive simulation techniques in Python.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aithernet.git
   cd aithernet

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- To start the basic simulation, run:
   ```bash
   python main.py

This command launches the prototype that simulates the life cycle and interactions of agents within the environment.

## Project Roadmap
- **Phase 1 – Basic Prototyping.** Implement the base classes for agents and the simulation environment.

- **Phase 2 – Core Engine Development.** Extend agent functionalities (behaviors, interactions, and dynamic updates).

- **Phase 3 – Interface and Advanced Features.** Develop a user interface (dashboard or graphical visualization) and integrate additional features (character customization, quests, etc.).

- **Phase 4 – Scalability and Monetization.** Integrate with cloud services, use containerization, and define branding/monetization strategies.
